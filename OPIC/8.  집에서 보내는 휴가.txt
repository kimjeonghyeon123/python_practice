- 대답
I usually stay at home during vacation. Because I don't want to be tired from doing something. I prefer to take a rest at home. There are a lot of things to enjoy at my home. like Tv, computer and so on. What I really love to do is watching drama. I'am totally busy these days. I don't have time to watch drama. So I mainly binge watch drama that I missed. And I catch up on sleep.

My favorite thing to do during vacation is Watching drama. I'm so busy these days, I don't have time to watch dramas. So when I have an vacation, I usually binge watch drama that i missed or i haven't seen it before. 
So a few months ago, I catched up on drama '나의 해방일지'. It was a very heartwarming drama. It hit home for me. This is best drama in my life. So it is my most memorable vacation.
