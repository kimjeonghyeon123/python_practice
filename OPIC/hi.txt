What I relly love about my house is a living room.

The one thing that I relly love about my house is a living room.

It's no longer painful. 더이상 괴롭지 않다.

If you want to watch a movie more comfortable, 
There is no better way to do it than going to a cgv.
영화 편하게 보고싶으면 cgv 보다 좋은 건 없어

It was heavy rain, So I had no choice but to go back home.
비가 많이 와서, 집에 갈 수 밖에 없었다.

It makes me feel happy. 기분 좋게 만든다.

It helps me get home. 집에 갈 수 있게 도와준다.
