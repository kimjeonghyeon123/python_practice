What I relly love about my house is a living room.

The one thing that I relly love about my house is a living room.

The reason why I love it is It's so comfortable.
내가 좋아하는 이유는 편해서이다.

It's no longer painful. 더이상 괴롭지 않다.

If you want to watch a movie more comfortable, 
There is no better way to do it than going to a cgv.
영화 편하게 보고싶으면 cgv 보다 좋은 건 없어

It was heavy rain, So I had no choice but to go back home.
비가 많이 와서, 집에 갈 수 밖에 없었다.

It makes me feel happy. 기분 좋게 만든다.

It helps me get home. 집에 갈 수 있게 도와준다.

내가 말하려는 건, 이거 정말 멋져

As I told you before
말했듯이

무조건 극장 갈 때마다 나는 화장실에 간다.

have you ever eaten it?
먹어본 적 있어?

I have been to New Zealand.
뉴질랜드 가본 적 있어

I'm worried that I won't be able to go to the famous restaurant that i reserved

Because of them, many foreigners became interested in k-pop

I think that you should not attempt to speak but attempt to listen
말하기보단 들어야된다.

It makes you stay calm
당신을 차분하게 만들어요

I'm so looking forward to it.
너무 기대돼

I hope that it's short walk from my house.
걸어서 갈 수 있었으면 좋겠다.
