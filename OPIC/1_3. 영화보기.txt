No matter what, Whenever I go to the theater, I always make sure to go to the toilet before movie starts. Because I don't want to be interrupted while I am watching a movie. I have an experience of going to the toilet while movie is screening. due to that, I missed some important scenes. It was really sadful experience. After movie ends, I usually have dinner with my friends and talk about movie.
