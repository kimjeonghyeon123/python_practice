4. P.70 여행 중 겪은 예상치 못한 문제

- 질문
Describe an issue you've faced while on a trip. What happened, and how did you handle it? Give as many details as possible.

- 대답
I have an experience of missing my flight. A few years ago, I travled jeju island with my friends. We rented a car near airport. But my friends were not good at driving. Because at that time, it wasn't that long time they got driving license. we scratched a car a little. So When we returned a car, it took a long time than we expected. Because of it, we missed our flight departure time. But I thought positively and bought a ticket for the next flight.

I like many activities during vacation. What I really love is traveling. So I usually go on a trip during vacation. The important point here is that I prefer to travel alone. It's a good way to relieve my stress. I can do anyting that I want without being conscious of other people. I can go anywhere I want to go and i can eat any food I want to eat. It's very attractive way to travel.
