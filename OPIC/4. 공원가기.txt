One experience comes to my mind. It was last summer. I took a walk alone at the park which is near my house as usual. It was really boiling hot. So I was going to take a rest in the shade for a while. At that time, I saw a men taking a rest in the shade. When I got close to him, I noticed that he was my old friend. So We asked each other how we were doing. we talked for a long time. We exchanged phone numbers. And we still cotact each other. It's an unforgettable experience that I had at the park.
