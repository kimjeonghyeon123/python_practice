How has the weather changed during the past few decades? How does the weather now compare to in the past? Please explain the differences.

There are a lot of differences between now and the past. The most different thing is the four seasons. There were four seasons in the past. But now, it seems to only have two seasons. summer and winter. Spring and Fall is too short. Even somebody said they were thoroughly gone. Summer is totally boiling hot and Winter is completely freezing. So people have trouble with weather change.

Tell me about a time when unexpected weather caused an issue for you. What was the problem, and how did you deal with it? Was anyone with you? Describe the situation and outcome.

I have an experience of canceling a plan due to heavy rain. These days, I play soccer with my friends on the weekend. As usual, I played soccer a few weeks ago. The weather forecast said that there would be no rain. But a few minutes after we started playing soccer, it started raining. It was really heavy rain. there was no better way to do it than going home. So we went to home and made an appointment for the next time.
