Currently, I can easily get a lot of information about health that I'm interested in. But When I was younger, almost fifteen years ago, there was little information. And also people had trouble getting correct health information. For example, when it comes to go on a diet, in the past, People didn't eat anything. It was really harmful. But now, People eat health food when they go on a diet. So it's really different from the past.
