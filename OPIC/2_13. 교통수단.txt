There are various types of transportaion in korea. like bus, subway, and the airplane. What I usually use is the Bus. It's just so comfortable and completely convenient. There are many buses. And you can find bus station all over the place. These days, there are a lot of convenient things to use. Such as usb port that I can charge my phone and free wifi that I can use while I take the bus. So this is why i prefer to take the bus.

There are big diffenrence between now and the past. In the past, I usually took a bus to go to the university which is located in incheon. This was the only way to go to there. And I had to tranfer three times. But now, I can go there at once by subway. it takes less time than bus. Even it is cheaper than the past.
